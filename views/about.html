	  	Adrian Sonnenschein is a computer programmer based out of Tucson, 
      Arizona.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	When he's not at a computer he's probably playing a guitar, cooking 
	  	delicious food, riding a bicycle or getting lost in the mountains with 
	  	his dog Huckleberry Finn.  He does his best to balance his healthy 
	  	lifestyle with delicious beers and lots of homemade ice cream.

	  	Contact him at <a href="mailto:adrian.sonnenschein@gmail.com">
	  	adrian.sonnenschein@gmail.com</a> if you'd like to pay him 
	  	to do some work or convince him to contribute to your free and open 
	  	source software (FOSS) project.
